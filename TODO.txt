= Known Issues:

* Component cannot define conflicting facets, commands or plugins, none of these are versionable.

* A faulty component's plugin may prevent entire system from working.

= FINISHED:

* Add -C=configuration.path.element=value,... option to override
  configuration settings. 

= TO DO:

* Solidify semantics of Component#status: status = unimplemented => disable Facet contributions

* Add basic run-time support for component introspection; see cabar/runtime.rb.

* Add support for -S= (select ) option.  This should override
  and component selections in configuration files for a given component name.

* Add support for CABAR_SELECT environment variable.

* Make Cabar::Base a mixin instead of an abstract base class.

* Change Context#required_components to an unordered Version::Set.

* Allow simple facet prototypes to be defined in cabar.yml.

* Allow documentation strings to Facet prototypes.

* Change Facet.key to Facet._proto_name to avoid collision with future use.

* Change Facet.owner to Facet._owner.

* Change Facet.component to Facet._component.

* Change Facet.context to Facet._context.

* Add support to automatically require top_level components, via an attribute on a component in its cabar.yml file.

= From discussion with Jeremy 2008/03/10

* Unit test against example directory.

== Version control plugins

* CABAR_REMOTE_PATH specifies a remote list of repositories:
* CABAR_REMOTE_PATH="svn://rubyforge.org/package ; http://foobar.com/cabar ; p4://"
* CABAR_REMOTE_DEST specifies where "cabar remote get" will put components.

    cbr remote get -R cnuapp/1.1
    cbr remote list
    cbr remote update 

== Configuration 

* Modify cabar config from command line.

    cbr config
    cbr config set select <component> 1.2

== Web Service Facet

* Need web_service facet

    cbr bin lshttpd start
    cbr bin apache start
    cbr action run httpd/start (???)

* Facets realizations are not scoped. Provide a mechanism to select particular component facets rather than entire components.

* action run should be only on top-level components by default.

    cbr action -T run test
    cbr action run test

* runsv facet

    cbr runsv install <component> ...
